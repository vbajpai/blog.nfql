The `START` and `END` timestamps on pretty-print are emitting garbage values.

	$ flow-cat traces.ft | flow-print -f 5

	Start             End                ...
	0309.03:21:34.835 0309.03:21:34.835  ...
	0107.18:47:30.422 0107.18:47:30.422  ...
	0825.21:13:44.389 0720.19:49:18.819  ...
	0627.22:48:48.456 0627.22:48:48.456  ...
	0502.00:22:40.523 0502.00:22:40.523  ...
	0305.12:08:28.306 0131.20:53:46.834  ...

It turns out the original `flow-tools v0.68` (1) does not work well with
`AMD64` (2). There is an active forked project of original `flow-tools`
(3) that works on 64-bit systems.

Installing [flow-tools 0.68.4 &rarr;](https://github.com/downloads/vbajpai/mthesis-src/flow-tools-0.68.4.tar.bz2)

	$ ./configure && make && make install
	$ flow-cat traces.ft | flow-print -f 5
	
	Start             End                ...
	1207.23:58:54.835 1207.23:58:54.835  ...
	1207.23:58:58.422 1207.23:58:58.422  ...
	1207.23:58:00.389 1207.23:58:54.819  ...
	1207.23:59:12.456 1207.23:59:12.456  ...
	1207.23:59:12.523 1207.23:59:12.523  ...
	
and now the engine also spits out timestamps in correct order:

	[engine] $ ./flowy-engine --debug traces-long.ft query.json
	
	Start             End                ...
	1207.23:58:54.835 1207.23:58:54.835  ...
	1207.23:58:58.422 1207.23:58:58.422  ...
	1207.23:58:00.389 1207.23:58:54.819  ...
	1207.23:59:12.456 1207.23:59:12.456  ...
	1207.23:59:12.523 1207.23:59:12.523  ...
